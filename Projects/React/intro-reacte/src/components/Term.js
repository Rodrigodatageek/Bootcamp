      Antidisestablishmentarianism A political position that developed in
      19th-century Britain in opposition to Liberal proposals for the
      disestablishment of the Church of Englandâ€”meaning the removal of the
      Anglican Church's status as the state church of England, Ireland, and
      Wales. The establishment was maintained in England, but in Ireland, the
      Church of Ireland (Anglican) was disestablished in 1871. In Wales, four
      Church of England dioceses were disestablished in 1920 and became the
      Church in Wales.
